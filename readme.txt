[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows the user to hide any topic from the board index and message index views.  It also allows the user to show the topic again, both from the topic display and the message index views.

In the [b]Profile[/b] area, a new section called [b]Hidden Topics[/b] has been added so that the users can show any topics they have hidden after-the-fact....

This mod only affects the [b]Board Index[/b], [b]Message Index[/b], SSI functions, and Unread topics functionality.  Any other functionality has not been affected.
