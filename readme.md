[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4126)

--------

## Introduction
This mod allows the user to hide any topic from the board index and message index views.  It also allows the user to show the topic again, both from the topic display and the message index views.

In the **Profile** area, a new section called **Hidden Topics** has been added so that the users can show any topics they have hidden after-the-fact....

## Known Issue(s)
This mod only affects the **Board Index**, **Message Index**, SSI functions, and Unread topics functionality.  Any other functionality has not been affected.

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings at this time.  To disable, you must uninstall this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.12, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up, as well as SMF 2.1 Beta 2.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
